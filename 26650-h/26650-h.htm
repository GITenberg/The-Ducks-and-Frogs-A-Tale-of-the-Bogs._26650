<div class="cpoem"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When cheerful Summer, bright and gay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Had brought once more her gift of flowers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To dress anew her pleasant bowers;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When birds and insects on the wing</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Made all the air with music ring;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When sunshine smiled on dell and knoll,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Two Ducks set forth to take a stroll.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'Twas morning; and each grassy bank</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Of cooling dew had deeply drank&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Each fair young flower was holding up</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Its sweet and freshly painted cup,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Filled with bright dew drops, every one;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Gay, sparkling treasures for the sun,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Who bears them lightly to the sky,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Holds them as vapor far on high,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Till with his rays in dazzling tints,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The rainbow on the cloud he paints.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But our two Ducks we'll not forget,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They were not troubled by the wet;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They rambled on, and soon they took</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The path that led them to a brook,</span><br />

<div class="cpoem"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Whose sparkling waters danced along,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With a gushing, rushing, rippling song.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The ramblers, when they reached the brink,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Stepped down to bathe, and take a drink.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They loved to frolic, dive and dash</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Beneath the water with a splash.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They washed and smoothed each glossy feather,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Then said, "let's have a swim together!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As moving gracefully, they went,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They heard loud tones of sad lament.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They listened, and did sharply look</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For cause of woe in that sweet brook;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And soon espied beneath some bushes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Among the reeds and tall, green rushes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A company of long-faced Frogs,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A delegation from the bogs;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sitting with their up-turned faces,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In attitudes to please the Graces,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Around a stone, on which was speaking</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A member of this grave marsh meeting.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Ducks were pleased; they knew them all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For very often they did call</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">At that sweet brook, to hear them sing;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They thought their music quite the thing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"And now," said they, "we will draw near,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For much they wished to see and hear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">What was this fuss and noise about,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So joined the party to find out.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Frogs received them with a smirk,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And gave their hands with nervous jerk.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Bowing and smiling in return,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Ducks prepared themselves to learn</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From what the Orator might say,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The cause of all their friends' dismay.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Now the chief speaker in this scene,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Dressed in a suit of bottle green,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Folding his arms across his breast,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Again the meeting thus addressed:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"My friends," said he, "I'm rather hoarse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And must be brief in my discourse;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But as these Ducks have joined our band,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I wish to have them understand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We have not come to this fair spot,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To break the peace or hatch a plot;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But we have met to form a plan</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To waken in the heart of man,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Pity for our sad condition.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We would present a grave petition,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Beseeching of the men who rule,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That we, lone dwellers of the pool,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">May be permitted to reside</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In safety, with our scanty tribe.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We humbly say there's no occasion,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To send an army of invasion</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Into our loved and quiet bogs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To murder happy, harmless Frogs.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Take our own dear sons and daughters,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Drag them from their winter quarters,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Then, when no heart with pity melts,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To cut them up as food for smelts!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Think what a very shocking fate,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Caught and killed, and used as bait,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To take those harmless little fishes</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To multiply man's dainty dishes."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Now, as the Frog this sentence spoke,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>Each brother gave a solemn croak.</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The gentleman in bottle-green</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Was quite exhausted by his theme;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He paused a moment, wiped his brow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Then said, "I think you will allow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We've been a persecuted race,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Since first on earth we had a place.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">There is, I'm told, a land called France,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Where all the people sing and dance&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And they acquire their easy grace</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">By living on our helpless race;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And though I say it with a sigh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'Tis this that makes them all so spry."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Puffing for breath, the speaker stopped</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And quickly from the stone he hopped.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Ducks, while listening to this tale,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Had felt their very hearts turn pale.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">At length, the largest of the two,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A handsome Drake, in green and blue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Arose, and opening wide his beak,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><i>Bowed, coughed</i>, and then began to speak.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Neighbors, I'm not a coward bird&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But the sad story I have heard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Would cause the boldest one to quake,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And makes my every feather shake.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I like the plan that you propose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To write a list of these your woes,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And ask for mercy from these men;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But have it done by some smart pen;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">If stated by some able writer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I think your fortunes may be brighter."</span><br />

<div class="cpoem"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Just at this moment, up there sprung</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A Frog quite pert, for one so young;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Said he, "I vote for emigration,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'Twill save us all this botheration!"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our proud Drake turned, in great surprise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">While grave rebuke flashed from his eyes.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Said he, "it makes my blood run cold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To see young folks so smart and bold.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">There's not a Duckling of my brood,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That would presume to be thus rude;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Young sir, I will a lesson give,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That may be useful while you live:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wait till your counsel others seek,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And then think twice before you speak!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For you, the elders of this tribe,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">I hope you here will still reside.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">In every pleasant brook and marsh,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">You'll meet with cares and trials harsh;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">If you'll but try to be contented,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Much that's wrong will be prevented.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">My lady Duck and I 'tis plain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Are wiser than when here we came.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We thought our lot was very hard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">When shut within the poultry yard;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Although 'tis large, and well supplied</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With water, and all else beside</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For happiness and comfort too,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Yet much we wished for something new.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our wings are clipped, we cannot fly,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And this too costs us many a sigh.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We seldom pass our owner's gate,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">He keeps his poultry rather straight.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We should not have been out to-day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But Duck and I just ran away;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And as we came to bathe this morn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Fretful we felt, and quite forlorn;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We thought our lot in life so sad,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And all our troubles quite too bad.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Could we have got our brood away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We had quit town this very day.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">As gloomily we stepped along,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The air was filled with many a song</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From happy creatures, gay and bright,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Rejoicing in the morning light.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The dew, o'er flowers and trees was flung,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Like diamonds pure, in drops it hung;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">All nature seemed reproaching us,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For making all this dismal fuss.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But we grew calmer as we walked,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Of all these cheering things we talked.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And hearing all your griefs and sighs,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Much better feelings did arise.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For let me tell you, friends and brothers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Listening to the woes of others,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And pitying their deep distress,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Will ever make our own seem less.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Then Patience whispers, (pray regard her,)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Your lot though hard, might still be harder.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Now, gossips, I am tired of speaking,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our Ducklings too we must be seeking;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Although it makes our heart-strings quiver,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">To see yon bright and pleasant river;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And hearing its cool waters splashing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We long beneath them to be dashing.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Yet we must close this visitation,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And without farther hesitation,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Resist our very strong desire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And cheerful to our homes retire.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our kindest wishes rest with you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">So, now good friends, we'll bid adieu."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Ducks then smoothed each ruffled feather,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And gracefully walked off together.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The Frogs with courtesy arose,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And stretched themselves high on their toes;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And so far conquered all their fears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They gave their friends three parting cheers!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Then as they sank upon the grass,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">This resolution they did pass:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Here, now, before we separate,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We pledge ourselves, to bear our fate</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">With patience; and if ill betide,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">We'll try to find some brighter side.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Our homes with cheerful tones shall ring,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And over every care <i>we'll spring</i>."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">They stopped; each folded his green dress</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">About him with much cheerfulness;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Shook hands all round, and said "good day,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Then merrily they <i>hopped away</i>.</span><br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
